# Adventures in Cement Tile Making: A Messy Tale of Creation

Who knew that making your own cement tiles would involve quite so much... everything? Cement in my hair, silicone under my fingernails, and a deep sense of satisfaction in my heart. Welcome to my ongoing adventure in handmade tile creation!

## The Art of Getting Messy

Let's be real - this isn't one of those pristine DIY projects you see on Instagram. This is real, hands-in-the-mud (or rather, cement) crafting. Between my full-time coding job and this creative endeavor, I've learned that:

- Cement doesn't care about your schedule
- Weekend warrior projects take on new meaning when each tile needs curing time
- You'll never look at your washing machine the same way again

## Making Magic with Molds

The journey began with creating silicone molds, a process that taught me:

- Food-grade silicone is surprisingly forgiving
- Patience isn't just a virtue, it's a requirement
- One mold leads to another... and another... (it's addictive!)

## The Grand Vision Coming to Life

Slowly but surely, the 200 square foot dream is becoming reality. The installation is an ongoing process because:

- Who knew making tiles could be so time-consuming?
- Full-time job + DIY ambitions = Weekend tile adventures
- Each section completed feels like a mini celebration

## The Technical Bits (For Fellow Curious Souls)

Each tile involves:

1. Cementall
2. Iron Oxide pigment
3. Curing time before using a cement sealer (this is when I catch up on Netflix)
4. Quality control (aka "Is this tile worthy of the floor?")

## Lessons From the Cement-Covered Trenches

- Time management takes on new meaning when you're juggling a tech career and renovation
- Some of the best results come from "mistakes"
- Having cement-dedicated clothes is non-negotiable
- Your friends will think you're slightly crazy (they're not wrong)

## The Ongoing Adventure

This project is still very much in progress because:

- Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither are handmade tiles
- Balancing full-time work with creative projects means embracing the slow journey
- Each weekend brings new challenges and victories
- The perfectionist in me keeps smashing previously mortared-to-the-floor tiles, to replace them with "better" tiles

## What's Next?

- Continuing the installation (one section at a time)
- Experimenting with new patterns (because why not?)
- Accepting that this is a marathon, not a sprint
- Probably buying more cement-dedicated clothes

Stay tuned for more updates as this adventure continues. And remember, if you see me with cement in my hair during a video call, now you know why!
