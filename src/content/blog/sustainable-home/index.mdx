# Building Our Dream: A Sustainable Home Journey in Crestone

There's something magical about creating a home with your own hands, especially when that home is designed to work in harmony with nature. My partner and I are embarking on an exciting journey to build our sustainable dream home in [Crestone, Colorado](https://estherjantzen.com/crestone-co-a-town-unlike-any-other/?doing_wp_cron=1742331701.1822850704193115234375), a unique mountain town known for its spiritual centers, alternative building practices, and stunning views of the Sangre de Cristo mountains.

## Finding Our Piece of Paradise

We've found our perfect slice of Colorado heaven in Crestone, located in Saguache County. The timing feels particularly serendipitous – the county currently has more relaxed building codes that are favorable to alternative construction methods. However, with stricter Colorado building codes potentially being enforced in the coming year, we're feeling a gentle urgency to begin our project while the regulatory environment still supports our vision.

## Learning from the Masters

Our journey to build this home hasn't been a straight path – it's been more like a beautiful spiral of learning different sustainable building techniques from various masters around the world.

### Earthship Academy Adventures

My first deep dive into sustainable building came through the [Earthship Academy](https://earthship.com/learn/). The experience was transformative, teaching me the intricate art of building with rammed earth tires, incorporating recycled materials like glass bottles and aluminum cans, and understanding how to create a home that includes a built-in greenhouse. The genius of Earthship design lies in its ability to:

- Maintain comfortable temperatures year-round through passive solar heating and cooling
- Harvest and recycle water
- Generate its own electricity
- Grow food right inside the home
- Turn "waste" materials into beautiful, functional building elements

### The Art of Earthbag Building

My education continued at [CalEarth](https://calearth.org/), where I learned the principles of earthbag construction. This method fascinated me with its:

- Simplicity and strength
- Low environmental impact
- Cost-effectiveness
- Disaster-resistant properties
- Beautiful organic forms

### Embracing Traditional Wisdom

The next chapter in our learning journey takes us to Panama, where I'll be studying traditional mud building techniques with [Turiya](https://www.turiyapanama.com/casa-de-quincha-cob-house/). This course promises to add another layer of knowledge to our toolkit, focusing on:

- Natural building materials
- Traditional mud construction techniques
- Integration with local climate and conditions
- Sustainable design principles
- Community-based building practices

## Our Vision

Drawing from these diverse building philosophies, we're designing a home that will:

1. Work with the land, not against it
2. Use primarily local and recycled materials
3. Minimize our environmental impact
4. Generate its own power and collect its own water
5. Include space for growing food
6. Create a comfortable, beautiful living space that inspires others

## Looking Forward

As we prepare to break ground (hopefully within the next year to take advantage of the current building codes), we're filled with both excitement and healthy nervousness. This project represents more than just building a house – it's about creating a living example of sustainable architecture that honors both traditional wisdom and modern innovation.

We'll be documenting every step of this journey, from the initial site preparation to the final touches. Whether you're interested in alternative building methods, sustainable living, or just enjoy watching crazy dreams come to life, we invite you to follow along!

Stay tuned for updates as we continue learning, planning, and soon, building our sustainable dream home in the shadow of the Sangre de Cristo mountains.
